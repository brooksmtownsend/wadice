# wadice Actor
![favicon](./static/favicon.ico)

This project came from a simple idea: I want an easy way to roll a d20 at all times. This is a great, simple use case for a wasmCloud actor, and there already is a [d20](https://crates.io/crates/d20) crate for this! With a little modification for the Wasm target, wadice was born.

This project is hosted on [Cosmonic](https://cosmonic.com) and you can roll a die at any time by clicking [here](https://little-moon-8040.cosmonic.app/)
